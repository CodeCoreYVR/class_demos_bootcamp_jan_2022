//AJAX - Asynchronous Javascript and XML

//AJAX is a set of techniques to fetch data from a server asynchronously
//without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page in the browser
//What this means is that our page loads while in the background AJAX fetches data
//from the server and makes it available for our use
